Hercules is an open-source tool for wind-based hybrid plant simulation in real time. Hercules is emulated a wind farm co-simulated other generation to form a hybrid plant that can include solar, storage and electrolyzers. The entire hybrid plant can be controlled using the [Wind Hybrid Open Controller (WHOC)](https://github.com/nrel/wind-hybrid-open-controller).

## Part of the WETO Stack

Hercules is primarily developed with the support of the U.S. Department of Energy and is part of the [WETO Software Stack](https://nrel.github.io/WETOStack). For more information and other integrated modeling software, see:
